            The rice purity test is a questionnaire of yes-no, containing 100 weird questions. The aim is to find the
            participant’s
            level of innocence and maturity. The result will arguably define how pure the participant is. It includes
            fun questions
            about relationships, sex acts, drug acts, alcohol, and bad habits. The rice purity test ranges from 0 to
            100. The
            participant will be considered as pure as high as the score is. The rice purity test will only work if you
            answer
            honestly. Some people also lie to get a high score, so that they could be considered pure and gentle.

            The rice purity test was originally developed at Rice University Houston, Texas in 1924 by a student
            council. The
            purpose of the test was to check the maturity level of the newbies who just got rolled in. It was helpful to
            make bonds
            among seniors and freshies.

            This test will let you know how virtuous or how naughty you are. So, the rice purity test will help you to
            judge your
            personality. It will tell you about your social circle and your private life. So, if you need to understand
            someone well
            simply ask about his/her Rice Purity test score. Over the passing years, this purity test has gone through
            different
            experiments and experiences to reach its modern form.

            The rice purity test was not as popular in its earliest days as it’s now. The reason behind its popularity
            and
            resurgence is social media. It has spread like a fire in the jungle in the past couple of years throughout
            the world.

        innocence in
        relation to their age group.
