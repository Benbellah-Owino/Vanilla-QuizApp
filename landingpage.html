        The Rice Purity Test is a questionnaire with 100 questions for both males and girls that covers topics like
        infringement, education, society, and your personal life.

        In other words, the Innocence Test is another name for the Rice Purity Test. It is created by the
        RicePurityTests team
        to assess a person's purity.

        The purity score is a number between 0 and 100. where 0 is the lowest score and 100 is the highest (a terrible
        score)
        (good score).

        The rice purity test was developed by Rice University in 1924 to assess students' levels of maturity and
        innocence in
        relation to their age group.

        The major goal of the rice purity test is to help the freshmen have a wonderful college experience and maintain
        strong
        emotional ties with their elders. <br>
